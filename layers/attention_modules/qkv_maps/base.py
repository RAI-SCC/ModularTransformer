    Abstract base class for all 'Qmap's

    'Qmap's are torch.modules with a consistent interface for use in mapping from an input to query, key or value of an
    attention_mechanism.
    All 'Qmap's should be initialized with the following arguments and any number of keyword arguments
        :param input_features int: number of input nodes and size of the feature dimension of the intended input
        :param q_features int: number of output features
        :param device Optional[torch.device]: computation device the module is initialized on
        :param device Optional[torch.dtype]: data type of the module
    The super.__init__ call should be done at the end of the __init__ method.

    Two 'Qmap's can be added yielding a KVmap, where the first argument becomes the K-component and the second the
    V-component. Similarly, Qmap + KVmap = QKVmap. KVmap + Qmap is intentionally disabled, since it would enable
    Qmap + Qmap + Qmap = QKVmap, which counterintuitively has the third input working as the Q-component. Use
    Qmap + (Qmap + Qmap) = QKVmap instead, if needed.

    Additionally, the methods as_KVmap()/as_QKVmap() create a KVmap/QKVmap that uses the Qmap for each component.
    Note that, while convenient, it is usually slightly more efficient to implement dedicated KV/QKVmaps

    The method _check_validity() is called at the end of the super.__init__ method (which is why it should be call last)
